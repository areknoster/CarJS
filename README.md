# CarJS
The final project on my journey in Computer Graphics subject at the university.
This one should be the most advanced. And it looks to be, but the reality is that I just glued together some parts from tree.js examples so that it fulfills project requirements. 

Note, I'm not very good with JS. Nevertheless, I've decided to publish, since it looks nice and I had fun doing it.

Run: 
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
then open in browser: http://localhost:8080
